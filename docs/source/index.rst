Welcome to SIDISH Documentation !
=================================

``SIDISH``  (Semi-supervised Iterative Deep learning for Identifying Single-cell High-Risk populations) is an advanced deep learning framework designed to revolutionize biomarker discovery and therapeutic target identification. By seamlessly integrating the comprehensive breadth of bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) with the granular depth of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), SIDISH empowers researchers to uncover High-Risk disease-associated cell populations, prognostic biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targetsâ€”laying the foundation for transformative advancements in precision medicine.

What is SIDISH?
===============

At its core, SIDISH is a semi-supervised iterative learning framework that bridges molecular data with clinical outcomes. It leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address one of the most pressing challenges in biomedical research: identifying the cellular and genetic drivers of poor patient outcomes.

SIDISH combines several key components to achieve this goal:

- **High-Risk Cell Identification:** Detects cell populations strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes through iterative refinement.
- **Prognostic Biomarker Discovery:** Uncovers key genetic markers linked to disease progression and patient survival.
- **In Silico Therapeutic Simulation:** Simulates gene perturbations to predict the impact of targeting specific genes, aiding in drug discovery and target validation.

SIDISH Framework Overview
==========================

The SIDISH workflow is structured around four key phases:

1. **Extraction of Cellular Heterogeneity:** Utilizing a variational autoencoder (VAE) to capture hidden cellular states from scRNA-seq data, preserving the biological complexity of tumor microenvironments.
2. **Survival Prediction with Transfer Learning:** Applying deep Cox regression models trained on bulk RNA-seq data to predict patient survival risks, effectively transferring learned representations across data modalities.
3. **Risk Stratification:** Identifying High-Risk cells and patient groups based on survival predictions, supported by robust statistical models for accurate risk categorization.
4. **Iterative Learning and Weight Updates:** Incorporating feedback loops using feature attribution methods (e.g., SHAP values) to iteratively refine gene and cell-level predictions.

Additionally, SIDISH features an in silico perturbation module, enabling virtual gene knockouts to simulate therapeutic interventions, predict drug responses, and prioritize targets for experimental validation.
